               <p>Diplomatic editions of MacGreevy's poetry were created from Collected Poems of Thomas MacGreevy: An Annotated Edition, edited by
                  Susan Schreibman (Anna Livia Press and The Catholic University of America Press,
                  1991). Images of MacGreevy's published poems were taken from MacGreevy's own copy
                  of
                  Poems (Heinemann, 1934). Manuscript copies are from
                  MacGreevy's papers at Trinity College, Dublin (individual manuscript numbers appear
                  in the witness list below).

                        <p>The alternative titles MacGreevy experimented with provide the key to this very
                           short poem. By the autumn of 1922 over six years had passed since Patrick Pearse
                           had proclaimed the Irish Republic in Dublin's General Post Office. The country had
                           seen the heart of its capital destroyed by the fires of Easter 1916, and this was
                           followed after the Seinn Fein victory in the 1918 election by an extended campaign
                           of guerilla warfare against the British with its reprisals and
                           counter-reprisals.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>In the end, nationalist Ireland was divided into bitterly opposing camps, and
                           engaged in civil war over the terms of the agreement reached in London in December
                           1921. The new national institutions that emerged did so more through the passage
                           of time than as the expression of any national ideal or vision. MacGreevy's poem
                           captures the despair and weariness of a nation torn apart by war and bitter
                           political divisions.

                                    hourglass, were frequently represented by Baroque and Renaissance

                                 <p>MacGreevy, however, may be thinking of one or more of the paintings that
                                    he saw during his visit to the Prado in Madrid in 1924. One is Goya's
                                    Saturn [Time] Devouring His Son, and the other is Pieter Brueghel the
                                    Elder's The Triumph of Death, which depicts a whole society visited by
                                    death riding a pale horse (using imagery from the Apocalypse) against a
                                    background of barren landscape and a darkened sky.

                           had proclaimed the Irish Republic in Dublin's General Post Office. The country had
                           seen the heart of its capital destroyed by the fires of Easter 1916, and this was
                           followed after the Seinn Fein victory in the 1918 election by an extended campaign
                           of guerilla warfare against the British with its reprisals and
                           counter-reprisals.

                           of time than as the expression of any national ideal or vision. MacGreevy's poem

               <p>The alternative titles MacGreevy experimented with provide the key to this very
                  short poem. By the autumn of 1922 over six years had passed since Patrick Pearse
                  had proclaimed the Irish Republic in Dublin's General Post Office. The country had
                  seen the heart of its capital destroyed by the fires of Easter 1916, and this was
                  followed after the Seinn Fein victory in the 1918 election by an extended campaign
                  of guerilla warfare against the British with its reprisals and
                  counter-reprisals.
               </p>
               
               <p>In the end, nationalist Ireland was divided into bitterly opposing camps, and
                  engaged in civil war over the terms of the agreement reached in London in December
                  1921. The new national institutions that emerged did so more through the passage
                  of time than as the expression of any national ideal or vision. MacGreevy's poem
                  captures the despair and weariness of a nation torn apart by war and bitter
                  political divisions.

                  Time in his chariot surrounded by symbolic devices such as the scythe and

               <p>MacGreevy, however, may be thinking of one or more of the paintings that

                  Saturn [Time] Devouring His Son, and the other is Pieter Brueghel the
                  Elder's The Triumph of Death, which depicts a whole society visited by
                  death riding a pale horse (using imagery from the Apocalypse) against a
                  background of barren landscape and a darkened sky.

               <div class="witnesses">t7989-1-9</div><strong>Biographical note: </strong> MacGreevy published several poems and
               reviews under the pseudonym L. St. Senan in the early-mid 1920s. Saint Senan
               (d.560) founded several monasteries in MacGreevy's native Ireland. Senan's last
               settlement was on Scattery Island in the estuary of the Shannon, near
               MacGreevy's birthplace.
