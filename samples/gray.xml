                  called me an artist and hop, hop, I was right on that chopper like Pavlov's dog.
                  They said it was only going to go up ten feet and then just land. All they needed

                  in Apocalypse Now, and then I realized that I was in a movie! They were filming
                  me, and I had no fear, even though the door was wide open and I was looking down.
                  Craig T. Nelson was practically falling out the door—we had no safety belts—but I
                  suddenly had no fear because the camera eroticizes the space! It protects you like
                  Colgate Guard-All. Even if the chopper crashed, at least there would be rushes,
                  right? My friends could show them on New Year's Eve at the Performing Garage.

                  one of the women who run dance halls in Pat Pong. So he did. He started to
                  actually fall in love with one, and to believe that he ran the night club with
                  her. And then he started thinking that he would stay behind after the film was
                  finished and open his own club in Pat Pong. His wife kept calling up, asking,
                  "Where's my husband?" At last she said, "You got him over there, you get him
                  back." It took four people to get him on that plane back to London. He said it

                  Thai marching troops passed in front of what was supposed to be Lon Nol's
                  reviewing stand. They were real Thai army troops playing Cambodians, and when the

                  When the drummer got to my shoulder I missed my cue. In 110 degrees, 888 troops
                  had to march all the way back. It took about twenty minutes. Then Sam missed a
                  cue. Then something went wrong with the camera. It took six takes, and by the

                  my fear of flying because it’s on camera! I have for some reason I have a feeling
                  that nothing bad’s gonna happen, that the camera key is eroticizes the experience
                  to a point of protection. But Craig T. Nelson, who’s sitting next to me—when the
                  door opens and you can look right down over the jungles like Apocalypse Now—is
                  terrifically afraid of flying, and he’s grabbing my knee and going, “Oh no don’t
                  land!” And we had to go through this about six times. He asked the nurse for
                  tranquilizers, she said, “I’m sorry we don’t keep them on the set.” Around the
                  third time around, Craig was letting out with rebel yells, you know he was about
                  hanging out of the thing. But you looked down and you realize how much of the
                  world, how much of that area the film had taken over! For twenty miles you could
                  see black smoke! They had Thai peasants all the way up up the Chao Phraya River
                  burning tires! You see, they had taken over twenty square miles just to make this
                  look like a war zone. </rdg>

                  slip this information to Sidney Schanberg about the bombing of Neak Luong, about
                  the accidental bombing. And um so I think that I’m not gonna have any problem with
                  the scene. It should go uh it should go pretty fast: it’s only a few lines. But
                  they uh slip me this new uh text, uh just a little addition to it. I mean as it
                  was it was very technical, I say, “you might glance at the USSAC’s reports on the
                  number of B-52 raids out of Thailand. My guess is they don’t have- they won’t have
                  uh decreased.” And then I say, “A computer malfunction put out the wrong set of
                  coordinates. Seems a single B-52 opened up over Neak Luong. There’s a homing
                  beacon right in the middle of town.” Now as as an actor I usually have to get
                  images for what I’m saying in order to memorize lines, so I’m given this new,
                  short text and I couldn’t get an image for “coordinates,” but I could remember
                  that. “B-52” I knew that. “Neak Luong” was a little problematic since it was a
                  night shoot and I was a little tired and hungover. I’d occasionally say “Luong
                  Neak.” You see. And then a “homing beacon.” So ever- I couldn’t get that, so I’d
                  get to- I was doing it very intently, I’d say, “Seems a single B-52 opened up over
                  Neak Luong.” And I got to “Neak Luong” and I’d go, “and … there’s a …” I couldn’t
                  get the image so I’d go, “There’s a … housing device in the middle of the town.”
                  <lb/> “Ok let’s roll it again, Take 52!”<lb/> So I go, “Seems a single B-52 opened
                  up over Luong Neak. There’s a …” <lb/> “Take uh 50 uh 3.” <lb/> “Seems a single 52
                  …” <lb/> “Take 54.” <lb/> “Seems a single B-52 opened up over Neak Luong. …” Then
                  there’s a very long pause, which I think will be effective because on film they

                  no way I was gonna get on a helicopter. Um they said well we'll just go up ten
                  feet, you know. They said, "would the artists please get on the helicopters." You
                  know they call us artist, you get on. So we get on I get on the helicopter and it
                  doesn't go up ten feet it goes complip! up woah! and Craig T. Nelson is sitting
                  beside me. There’s a gunner there, the door's completely open, you're looking down
                  a jungle. I felt like I was in a movie--in Apocalypse Now--and I was in a movie:
                  The Killing Fields. And suddenly I had no fear because I realized the camera was
                  aimed at the helicopter and I was in the protection, the erotic protected magic
                  shield of the camera. And I had no fear and I'm looking down at the jungle, I
                  thought even if it crashed there'd be footage of it and my friends could show it
                  on New Years Eve, you know there'd be some documentation of the death, that made
                  the death great. And down below is this smoke coming up and for twenty miles you
                  can see that the film has taken over the entire jungle. And there are peasants
                  down there burning rubber tires to make it look like a war. </rdg>

                  Penh. And I'm walking down with him. Now all I have to do is say this very simple
                  thing, and I have to go, "A computer malfunction put out the wrong set of
                  coordinates. Seems a single B-52 opened up over Neak Luong. There’s a homing
                  beacon right in the middle of town. Check it out, Sid.” <lb/> Oh it's easy enough,
                  but for me as an actor I have to have an image of what I'm talking about. It's
                  hard for me to do statistics. It's a very straight, serious scene. It's a night
                  shoot: I'm hoping it will be done in an hour or so. <lb/> So I go, “a computer
                  malfunction”: okay, I got an image of guys pulling wires out of a computer. Uh
                  "put out the wrong set of coordinates": I had to look that up, I see a gridwork,
                  right? Um "seems a single B-52": alright I remember the B-52s from television when
                  I was ea- eating in front of the TV during the Vietnam War. I could see those
                  bombs coming down. "Opened up over Neak Luong": I was a little hungover from the
                  night before so I was saying "Luong Neak" and uh missing it, you know. <lb/>

                  would be drinking a lot- it's amazing what people do to get in character in the
                  film. There's one British actor that was playing a reporter. He was a family man
                  from suburbs of London. He was convinced that his character would fall in love
                  with a Thai Mamasan. A Mamasan is the woman that runs the whorehouse. He did. He
                  fell in love with this Mamasan, and pretty soon he began to think that he was
                  running the bar. He had the fantasy he was running her bar. And pretty soon he
                  began thinking he was gonna open his own bar in Pat Pong. By now he was through
                  with the role, his wife was calling up and saying, "Where's my husband?" It took
                  four people to get him on the Thai Air. Halfway to London he realized he had
                  flipped out, he had gone crazy. <lb/> So I figured I was kind of in character, I
                  was a little shaky. So I go, “A computer malfunction put out the wrong set of
